# Mumbai Housing Management

Welcome to the **Mumbai Housing Management** project! üè†‚ú®

This mini-project, my first of the year and in Machine Learning, dives into **data visualization techniques** to explore the dynamic housing landscape of Mumbai. Using powerful Python libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, this project analyzes and visualizes key insights about housing trends in one of India‚Äôs busiest cities.



## Project Overview

This project uses a sample dataset representing housing data from various regions of Mumbai, focusing on attributes like:

- **Regions**: South Mumbai, Western Suburbs, Central Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Thane, and Eastern Suburbs.
- **Price**: Housing prices in crores.
- **Size**: Size of properties in square feet.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Property Type**: Apartment or Villa.
- **Units Sold**: Number of units sold in each region.



## Key Features

1. **Dataset Exploration**:
   - Comprehensive summary and analysis of the dataset, including missing values and statistical measures.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Plot**: Average price of flats in different regions of Mumbai.
   - **Box Plot**: Price distribution across various regions.
   - **Line Graph**: Units sold versus property type.
   - **Pie Chart**: Distribution of property sizes across regions.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Comparison of price and property size, categorized by region.
   - **Heatmap**: Visualizing relationships between price and size across regions.

3. **Techniques Used**:
   - Data manipulation with **pandas**.
   - Numerical analysis using **numpy**.
   - Stunning visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.



## Insights & Learning

Through this project, I discovered how to:
- Use data visualization to identify trends and patterns in housing data.
- Interpret complex datasets to generate actionable insights.
- Combine multiple libraries to enhance visualization and storytelling.



## Results

This project provides a clear picture of Mumbai's housing market, revealing:
- Price variations across regions.
- Trends in property sizes and types.
- Patterns in units sold and their correlations with property attributes.

The insights gained from this project make it a fun and engaging way to learn the basics of data visualization in Machine Learning.


## Next Steps

In the future, I plan to:
- Expand this project with larger datasets.
- Apply advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
- Explore deeper insights into real-world housing data.



## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
